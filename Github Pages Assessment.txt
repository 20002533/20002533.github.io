InstructionsFollow the steps listed in this assessment item.Submission of the documentation, code, and associated items is at the end of each part of the
portfolio.Each part of the portfolio has a deadline for submission. It is advantageous to you to attempt to meet the deadline provided.
ImportantIf you are using a different configuration of tools and equipment for this assessment item, then assistance in this and subsequent parts of the
portfolio to ensure the systems work correctly will be limited.Make sure you put your name and student ID on the front page. Failure to do so will mean
your submission will not be marked. 

ScenarioYou have just started working for a boutique Perth-based software development company. The company uses git for source control and GitHub for hosting
their git repositories and providing remote access. To foster a culture of collaboration, the company also requires you to set up a GitHub pages website
to introduce yourself and blog about your progress. GitHub pages is a free service that renders a specially-named git repository as a website. The repository
can contain markdown or HTML.Your workstation will already have the necessary tools (git) installed. However, it is not yet configured for the workplace.
Moreover, the company has an open policy on BYO devices so you may want to install Git on your own computer and be mindful of settings that need to be
applied globally. 

Answering QuestionsWhen a step includes a question, you must attempt to answer it.There is a minimum and maximum number of words to use for each answer.If
a step has more than one question, these maxima and minima are a total for all the questions in that specific step.All answers must be in complete sentences
unless indicated.If required, make sure to add any code you’ve written in a separate file to your submission. DO NOT put code in a Word document.
Sources of InformationIn industry, it is good practice to keep track of where information was obtained. This is especially true if it is a written document,
or even code.If you answer any questions using information from web sites, please include the site name and URL (Web site address) after the answer. Likewise,
include the title and author for books and magazine articles. For example:
list of 2 items

RS Electronics Ltd: 
https://au.rs-online.com/

Slack API Documentation, Users List Method: 
https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list
list end
Code StorageWe advise that you create a GIT repository on GitHub and use this to store a copy of your work. You may also use OneDrive within your college
Office365 to store a backup of your code or keep a copy on a USB thumb drive.Please note that it is the student’s responsibility to keep backups of their
work. This includes any documents and code.

STEP
TASK TO PERFORM
WordsMin/Max
00
Example questionThis is an example step. It may contain instructions or a question.If a minimum and maximum word count are provided, you must take those
into account. 


Your answer or evidence (e.g., screenshots) go in this box. This box will grow automatically as you put in text and images.

01
Create GitHub accountYour company’s policy is to use GitHub (and git) for version control. Any new repositories will be created in GitHub and cloned locally.
If you haven’t already done so, please create a new GitHub account. You may use your student email address to set up the account or use your own email
address. Follow the instructions provided by GitHub and/or your lecturer to set up your account and provide evidence (screenshots) below. If you already
set up a GitHub account earlier, also provide evidence (screenshots) below.
n/a
Address for student GitHub account below:
https://github.com/20002533

02
Local InstallationThe company communicates with you that to install and configure git locally, you will need to ensure the following:
list of 2 items
The default branch name should be set to main
You must configure Git with your employee number [use student number] as the username and company email [use your TAFE email]
list end
list of 4 items
a.Research and write down the git commands needed to do the above and then run them locally. Include a screenshot to evidence your actions.
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config user.name 20002533
git config user.email 20002533@tafe.wa.edu.au

b.Do these settings apply to all repositories? Qualify your answer.
The above settings apply to all repositories created on the local computer, eg the computer the employee is working on.

c.What disruptions to collaborative work do you think could occur if company personnel were not given these specific instructions
If employees were not instructed on how to set up their Git environment on their local computer, they would not be able to use Git's version control capabilities to enable the exchange of data across all sectors of the organization, thereby hampering company productivity.

d.Why does the organisation need to give you these instructions as opposed to centrally configure them?

list end
3-5 sentences
This is important because every employee needs to be able to have their own Git environment set up so as to enable the fetching, pushing and pulling of company assets across the organization. They will mostly be working from their local setup but they will also have their own storage spaces/repositories on the github website.

03
Create personal repositoryIn your account, create a new repository following the procedures from GitHub or provided by your lecturer. In this case, make
sure you name the repository username.github.io. and replace username with your own GitHub username. You must follow this convention, or it will not work
properly. Provide evidence (screenshots) of your newly created repository down below.
n/a
Address for new repository provided below:
https://github.com/20002533/20002533.github.io

04
Create a local cloneIn this step, you will create a local clone of the repository you created in the previous step. It is assumed you will be running all
git commands in a terminal (sometimes called console, or command line). Use the instructions from GitHub or provided by your lecturer to create a local
clone of the new repository on your workstation. Run git remote -v to show the local repository’s remote counterpart.Provide evidence of the clone and
the directory into which it was cloned below (use screenshots).
n/a
git clone https://github.com/20002533/20002533.github.io 

05
Create a personal web pageThere are multiple steps to this question. Document each step with a screenshot. 
list of 6 items
a.
In your local directory, create a file called index.md
code index.md

1. Add the following line to this, where you replace Name with your own name:
# Name
#20002533#

b.Add the file to your “staging” environment in the main branch (the default branch): git add index.md
git add index.md

c.Commit the file with a suitable commit message:git commit -m ‘First commit’
git commit -m "first-commit"

d.Run the following command to investigate the local repository’s status:git status
git status

e.Push your changes to the remote repository:git push
git push

f.Check that your page is now live at username.github.io, where username is, of course, your own username.
https://github.com/20002533/20002533.github.io
list end
n/a
  
06
Making a changeYour personal web page on GitHub Pages is still a bit, well, bare. So, you decide to add some information to it. You’re not too worried
about making it pretty, yet. Follow the instructions and provide evidence for each step. Create a local branch:git checkout -b update-profile
git checkout -b update-profile
Check that you are indeed working on your new branch:git status
git status
On branch update-profile
Open the file index.md in your favourite editor and add the following lines after the existing markdown
code (please, customise them for your situation, especially the date):
### Profile- **Started**: today’s date- 
**Role**: Software Developer- 
**Hobbies**: Rowing, Reading, and Role-playing
code index.md
### Profile- **Started**: 27/08/2024- 
**Role**: Computer Programmer- 
**Hobbies**: Reading, listening to horse racing, ballroom dancing

Add index.md to the staging and commit it: git add git add index.md
git commit -m “Updated my profile”
git commit -m updated-my-profile
Push your changes to the remote
repository. The command looks a bit different because you are working on a new branch:
git push --set-upstream origin update-profile

Important! Take notice of the information that this command has provided. You will need this in the next step. 
n/a
  
07
Creating a Pull RequestTo integrate your changes into your actual profile page, you will need to merge the changes into the main branch. But first, you
will create a Pull Request (PR).The previous command provided a link with a message that said Create a pull request (…) by visiting:Open this link in your
web browser (you should be logged in to GitHub. If you are not logged in: do so first.)You can now create a so-called Pull Request. GitHub will pre-fill
most fields, so you can simply click “Create pull request”. 
A screenshot of a computer
Description automatically generated with medium confidence
GitHub will create a new Pull Request. It will have a name and a number, for example, Updated profile #1. Provide evidence of your Pull Request below (screenshot).
https://github.com/20002533/20002533.github.io/pull/1
n/a

08
Merging the Pull RequestThe final part to this process is to merge the Pull Request (remotely and locally). GitHub provides the tools needed to do that.
Make sure you have the page with the Pull Request open in GitHub. It should look like this:
Graphical user interface, text, application, website
Description automatically generated
There are different ways of merging, but in this instance, you may use the default ‘Merge pull request’ as suggested by GitHub.Click on ‘Merge pull request’
(this will add a new text input on the screen, which you may ignore), then confirm the merge by clicking ‘Confirm merge’. Important: do not delete the
Pull request at this stage. Reload your personal page in a browser. It may take a few minutes for the changes to show up. (Reminder: the link is username.github.io.)
https://github.com/20002533/20002533.github.io/pull/1
Update your local repository:
list of 2 items
a.First, switch back to your main branch:git checkout main
git checkout main

b.Next, fetch the changes from your remote repository:git pull 
list end
This will ensure your local repository is again synchronised with your remote repository. Provide evidence of the entire merging process in the form of
screenshots.
n/a
git pull 

09
Inform required personnel of the workThe last step of this assignment is to inform required personnel of the work you have done. In this case, you will
inform your lecturer. But ensure you inform them as though they are your line manager. Write them a polite email saying you have done the work. Include
the following information:
list of 2 items
-Your repository on GitHub (link)
-The link to your personal profile page
list end
You do not need to send the email but include a screenshot below
n/a
